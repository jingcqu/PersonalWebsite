            <h2>Hello... I am</h2>
            <p>A double major in Computer Science and Math major from Texas A&M Graduating in May 2020. I'm well-versed in Object Oriented Programming languages and Analytics from College projects and Internships. I started out as a Biology Major but soon
                found out I didn't have the stomach for the labs which led me to do a 180 and do what I was always passionate about which was to work with Computers - beautiful, solid un-fleshy things. I'm well-versed in Object Oriented Programming languages
                and Analytics from College projects and Internships. Through my college career, I've become a diligent student and I'm looking forward to applying what I've learned to my profession.</p>

                            Intern/NTP (Non-Traditional Personnel) - Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP): Summer 2019 I conducted data analysis and provided technical support on several research Projects that used the lab's high-performance computer. Most notably using tools
                            such as plink, LDpred, and PRSice to calculate Polygenic Risk Scores. There are still Papers under preparation.

Houston. In this study, I did the data analysis using the PLINK software, and identified the association of ancient adaptive mitochondrial DNA haplogroups and type 1 diabetes.
                    This work was presented at the 2019 ASHG annual meeting in Houston as a poster.
